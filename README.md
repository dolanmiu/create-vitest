# Create Vitest

> A command line utility tool to generate and scaffold vitest test files with good practices.

## Usage

### Regular usage

```bash
$ npx create vitest
```

Or

$ npx create-vitest
```

### Specifying a file

This is a short-cut, but otherwise it's the same as above. If the file name is not specified, it will be prompted.

```bash
$ npx create vitest <file-name>
```

Or

```bash
$ npx create-vitest <file-name>
```
